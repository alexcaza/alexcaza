### Hey, I'm Alex (he/him) 👋🏻

I'm a senior full-stack product engineer.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I've been building on the web for ~15 years
- 🧪 I love jamming with product teams to help solve people's problems
- 🧑🏻‍🎨 I believe engineers should spend more time learning about design thinking
- 🤝 I think cross-team collaboration/ideation/planning should be baked into product processes

Curious about what makes a product engineer? I tried to define the role here:
