### Hey, I'm Alex 👋🏻

I'm a senior full-stack product engineer.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I 've been building on the web for ~15 years
- 🧪 I love jamming with product teams to help solve people's problems
- 🧑🏻‍🎨 I believe engineers should spend more time learning about design thinking

Curious about what makes a product engineer? I tried to define the role here: [https://alexcaza.com/personal/the-rise-of-product-engineering/](https://alexcaza.com/personal/the-rise-of-product-engineering/)
